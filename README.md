# Numeric-Analysis-of-Quasi-1D-Nozzle-Flow
This repo contains numeric analysis of one dimension quasi nozzle flow. Using computational methods, this project explores the behavior of fluid flow through a nozzle, offering insights into pressure, velocity, and other key parameters along the nozzle length. The repository includes Python scripts implementing numerical algorithms such as finite difference methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. We used methods like grid discritization, Mackormack Technique and time step calucation for proper analysis.

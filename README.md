# Numeric-Analysis-of-Quasi-1D-Nozzle-Flow
This repo contains numeric analysis of one dimension quasi nozzle flow. Using computational methods, this project explores the behavior of fluid flow through a nozzle, offering insights into pressure, velocity, and other key parameters along the nozzle length.
